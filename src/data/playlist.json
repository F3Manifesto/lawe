    "description": "Live from LES, an underground K$D location, this is the inaugural launch session of LAWE, featuring late night contemplations, iconoclastic ideas, and a curated cc0 playlist. The reality is that almost everything today is locked down by the cartels and old corporate behemoths that couldn't give a fuck about you, me, us, the world and any of the harsh tragedies that continue to plague every nation globally. The emotion is that I can't be involved with anything non-CC0 anymore; and until that reality becomes closer, the audio identity I want to listen to, engage with, have me feel something, must be free (dom), entirely."
